# Exploring Expenditures

This repository contains the code I'm writing to explore my debit card transactions. I downloaded a CSV file containing all of my debit card transactions. This file is not included in this repository because of privacy concerns. 

The `cleaning.py` file cleans the data and writes the cleaned data to a new file called `clean_transactions.csv`. 

The `monthly_spending.py` file then calculates my monthly expenditures and plots them on a bar chart, using the `clean_transactions.csv` file.

Please note that this is a work in progress, because there are more insights I intend on extracting from my debit card transactions.
